shiftty (ShifTTY) - Shapeshift Cryptocurrency Exchange Terminal

*INCOMPLETE* - This repository is mainly to track changes and sync between
different devices. The program is a personal project that will most likely
stay in active development and/or never be completely finished. 

ShifTTY is a command-line interface to the cryptocurrency exchange Shapeshift
using its API. It was originally intended to be a simple interactive terminal
that reduces mouse movements and clicks to text commands. After basic
functionality is complete, further updates will act as modular components
or expand compatability.
